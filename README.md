# Omarov_HW2_MCU
Ring image transmission by two microcontrollers. The image is transmitted via a parallel port, and is received via USART.
The image is recorded in a ring buffer, after which it is recorded in SDRAM and output to TFT.
Using the buttons, you can get to the menu and perform transformations of the contained image:
<ul>
  <li>Turn</li>
  <li>Conversion to BW</li>
  <li>Restoring the original from memory</li>
  <li>Back to image</li>
</ul>
